# v4react
Reactjs validation for both - class and hook components. In case of class components it can be used with two approaches:
  * Template driven approach - uses custom components. Adding and managing new validation components are easily handled.
  * Model driven approach - Validation model structure is being defined and used with plain html components.

Hook components approach defines validation methods which are easily used with react hooks.
